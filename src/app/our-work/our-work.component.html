        Mobile phone technology — and the coding skills required to develop it —
        can serve a greater purpose than simply feeding our gaming and social media habits.
        This was what 50 Girl Scouts learned at the second annual Quinnipiac Girl Scouts Hackathon, held on our York Hill Campus.
        <br />The event had the girls work in teams of five to design and develop a mobile app for the
         benefit of a specific non-profit organization that had been assigned to them.
        Each team was assigned a Quinnipiac student to serve as a mentor to help with the initial meeting,
         lead them through design exercises, techniques and processes and help them transition from the design phase to the coding phase.

The teams spent their morning focused on visual design,
 and devoted the afternoon to building their app utilizing Appinventor,
 a highly accessible web tool used for coding mobile Android-based applications.
 “These kids were dropped off in the morning as mobile users. When they were picked up that afternoon,
 they were mobile inventors,” Blake said. “It was just incredible to see their parent’s reactions.”

        Girls Who Code is a non-profit organization
        dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology through free after-school programs that let
        students use computer science to impact work on projects to impact their community and
        join a sisterhood of supportive peers and role models. Qaisha Closeil who said she was inspired to bring the club on campus by lawyer,
        politician, founder and CEO of Girls Who Code Reshma Saujani after hearing about Saujani visiting the university back in Fall 2016.

        Overall, Closeil said she is excited for the program because she knows first-hand how
        there is a huge gender gap when it comes to computer science fields and she hopes to
        inspire the girls to further learn about the field and even be inspired to one day attend the university.
        “I like how we have [the club] on QU’s campus. They’ll get the best of both – learning about computer science
         and being kind of a college student,” Closeil said. “Maybe they’ll have an interest in coming here.”      </p>
